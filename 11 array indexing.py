#NumPy array indexing

#access array elements
#array indexing is the same as accessing an array element
#you can access an array element by referring to its index number

#the indexes in NumPy arrays start  with 0
#meaning that the first element has index 0, and second has index 1, etc

#get the first element from the following array

import numpy as np
arr=np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
print(arr[0])
